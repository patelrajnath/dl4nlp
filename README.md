# rnn4nlp
This contains:

(1)RNN based system for word level quality estimation. 

(2) Parts-of-Speech-Tagger for Code-mixed social media text. 

This include the implementation of varous RNN models including simple Recurrent Neural Network, Long-Short Term Memory,DeepLSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit. The system is flexible to be used for any word level tagging task like Named Entity Recognition etc.
